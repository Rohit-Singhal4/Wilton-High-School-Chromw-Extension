# Wilton-High-School-Chrome-Extension

**Description**</br>
WHS Chrome Extension for Library Learning Commons</br>
This chrome extension was created as a part of an internship with Wilton High School Located in Wilton, CT. The chrome extension was created in order to provide easy access to important school resources during a pandemic. The extension provided quick links to crucial websites and databases but also allowed LLC staff to directly update students on any events and changes that occur. The extension contained a set of buttons linked to resources and an embedded google document that could only be accessed by extension moderators. The extension was created using a combination of JSON, HTML, and CSS. </br>

Alongside the extension, I created a short programming guide so inexperienced staff could maintain the extension and change anything they needed to change. This included how to change images used for buttons, changing links, directions for changing the google doc and various other things. 

**Installation and Use**</br>
Installation and Usage should not require any additions to the code. Simply, download it to your computer and upload it to the google chrome extension store. The current extension also should be able to be found on the chrome extension store already as it was previously uploaded.
